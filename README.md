# WorkShare

The WorkShare application is a groundbreaking solution that leverages blockchain
technology to address multiple challenges in project management and compensation.  

In the current business environment, companies and employees in Romania face
the weighty burden of government taxes and contributions, ranging from 35% to
47.25% of the gross salary [Ana23a], alongside the additional transfer costs imposed
by banks. This dual challenge places a substantial financial strain on businesses.
However, WorkShare offers a solution using the power of blockchain technology. By
leveraging this innovative technology and Polygon network, WorkShare minimizes
transaction fees to nearly zero, optimizes payment processes, and significantly re-
duces tax and contributions obligations on earnings by up to 78% taking advantage
of the 10% tax for earnings that come from cryptocurrencies [Ana23b] . This cost-
effective alternative provides much-needed relief for companies, empowering them
to allocate resources more efficiently and stimulate growth in the digital economy.
Additionally, the application addresses scalability concerns faced by companies.
By connecting companies with a pool of skilled developers, WorkShare ensures a
consistent workflow and project availability, regardless of the companyâ€™s current
project load.
Furthermore, WorkShare addresses the challenge of finding hardworking soft-
ware developers, especially when limited to local talent pools. By leveraging blockchain
technology, developers from different countries can participate, eliminating high
fees associated with international salary transfers and expanding the talent pool for
companies.
In conclusion, the WorkShare application provides an innovative solution to the
challenges faced by companies and developers in project management and com-
pensation. By leveraging blockchain technology, it addresses high fees and trans-
fer costs, enhances scalability, and expands access to a global talent pool. Work-
Share revolutionizes the way projects are executed, paving the way for increased
efficiency, transparency, and collaboration in the digital economy.
