In the current business environment, companies and employees face the weighty burden of government taxes and contributions, ranging from 35\% to 47.25\% of the gross salary  in Romania \cite{anaf-contributii}, alongside the additional transfer costs imposed by banks. This dual challenge places a substantial financial strain on businesses. Another significant challenge is finding hardworking software developers and scalability, especially when limited to local talent pools.

The application proposed in this thesis titled WorkShare, is a groundbreaking solution that leverages blockchain technology to address multiple challenges in project management and compensation. It offers a solution using the power of blockchain technology, smart contracts  and Polygon network . WorkShare minimizes transaction fees to nearly zero, optimizes payment processes, and significantly reduces tax and contributions obligations on earnings by up to 78\% taking advantage of the 10\% tax in Romania for earnings that come from cryptocurrencies \cite{anaf} and even by 100\% in countries like Belarus, where the earnings from cryptocurrencies are not taxed. WorkShare offers an economical alternative that brings significant relief to companies, empowering them to optimize resource allocation and drive growth in the digital economy. Furthermore, it provides additional incentives for developers and introduces a unique NFT proof system that validates their skills and project accomplishments. 

Additionally, the application addresses scalability concerns faced by companies by connecting companies with a pool of skilled developers from around the world, WorkShare ensures a consistent workflow and project availability, regardless of the company's current project load.
 
With WorkShare, companies can achieve greater efficiency in resource management, foster a thriving digital economy, and reward developers for their contributions through the innovative NFT proof mechanism.
